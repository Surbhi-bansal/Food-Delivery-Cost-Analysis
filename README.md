# Food-Delivery-Cost-Analysis
This project aims to analyze the financial aspects of a food delivery dataset. By cleaning and processing the data, I extracted valuable insights into costs, profits, and customer behaviors. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the financial dynamics within the food delivery service.
